# Rebekahho - My solution to the assignment

This is my third assignment on BGIT

# Overview

The objective of this assignment is to create a simple webpage introducing myself or any topic of my choice and apply CSS styles to enhance its visual appearance. In this assignment, I practised styling of headings, paragraphs, and images
using both internal and external CSS methods. I was also able to experiment with different CSS properties and values to enhance the visual appearance of my webpage. I used color, font styles, margins, paddings, and borders to make my webpage visually appealing.

I made sure I used proper indentation and comments in my CSS code to improve readability.
I also used media queries to make sure the webpage is responsive and displays well on different screen sizes (e.g.,
desktop, tablet, mobile).

# Code editor
This website was built with VSCode

# What I learnt

In the process of building this webpage, I learnt how to use flexbox and how to add height and width to my image.
I also found out a website to generate colors for websites. You should check it out. The link is attached above.

# Continued Development

In case you come across this code, and you notice there is something I could have done better, kindly make your suggestions. The repo is public!!

Thank you

My name is Rebecca and I built this webpage.
